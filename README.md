# OO code using turtle graphics
- use abstractmethod
- create class shape that have method to set up the background, color and position
- create artgenerator class to make it draw picture
- call other sub-class that have Artgenerator as master class
- have some problems in sub-class that require 2 reduction_polygon inside big polygon, I can't make those reduction_polygon in the middle of big polygon
- update: I already fix art5-9
- In order to fix them, I borrow code from original polygon_art file and add position to fix it.
